Hello Professor Petkovic and Souza, 

Here is the link to test my individual assignment URL  https://ckrobinson.github.io/CSC642-IndividualAssignment/

For the development I used Bootstrap 5.
For field validation I used Bootstrap 5 and javascript.
For maps I used the GoogleMaps API.
For captcha I used ReCaptcha.

For testing I used the SeleniumIDE and tested all of the form fields entering data and making sure the data reched the results page properly.
In the attachment please find screen shots of the results of the automated testing.

For this work I worked alone with no help from other students.

Documentation and Code I developed for this assignment are in github https://github.com/ckRobinson/CSC642-IndividualAssignment

Regards, 

Cameron Robinson
